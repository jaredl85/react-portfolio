                            <h3>Process and Challenges</h3>
                            <p>My process was first to conduct a competitive analysis of other web development portfolio sites. My goal here was to get a sense of what I personally liked, design ideas, and design choices that might be less effective for my goals. Once I had looked through quite a few portfolios, I mocked up my own, using Wireframe.cc. I put together a color palette and fonts for the site.</p>
                            <p>The process of coding was challenging in the early stages of this project. I quickly realized how much I still didn’t know. However, learning React through the process of actually developing with it is immensely rewarding - looking back, I’m grateful for the challenges I ran into. I feel that I now have a much stronger grasp on how to use the React library to develop a project from start to finish.</p>
                            <p>The deployment process ended up taking quite a bit longer than I had initially anticipated, as I ran into issues with hosting my build files. However, after going through the process of debugging my application, I managed to fix the errors that were preventing my app from properly rendering (it wound up being an issue with how I’d implemented my Routing, which I was able to fix quickly once it had been identified).</p>
                            <p>However, this wasn’t time wasted - I learned a lot about debugging, how JSON files are used, and how to Google more effectively.</p>

                            <p>At the end of this project I ended up with a mobile-friendly portfolio project to showcase my work, built entirely using the React library (and, of course, a generous amount of SASS). I’m pleased to report that my portfolio site is very close to what I had envisioned during the design phase.</p>
