                            <p>I was asked by a Seattle-based dog-trainer to design a website from the ground-up for his dog training business, The Dog Within.</p>
                            <p>He wanted an aesthetically pleasing website that conveyed a bit of information about who he was and what he does. His biggest request was to have the ability to receive emails through the website contact form.</p>

                            <h3>Process and Challenges</h3>
                            <p>The main challenge for this project is that, while my client had a business page on Yelp, he had very little in the way of branding. He wasn’t sure exactly what the website should say or what it should look like. Which meant handling all aspects of planning, design, content creation, and implementation for the website.</p>
                            <p>The secondary challenge was that I had no idea how to implement a functional contact form - my only experience with web design and development at this point had been strictly front-end. Which meant a learning curve before the project could be fully implemented.</p>
                            <p>To begin, I conducted a competitive analysis of several other Seattle-based dog training websites, to get a sense of what kinds of content was available, what design strategies were being used, what was being done well by other businesses, and what we might be able to do better.</p>
                            <p>I then met with the owner of The Dog Within to discuss my findings and interview him about his business, his philosophy, and to get a sense of what The Dog Within stood for. We discussed project scope, possible design ideas, and timeline.</p>
                            <p>Based on my client interview and the competitive analysis I had conducted, I wrote the majority of the content for the site. Once this was approved, I created a few design mock-ups of the site in photoshop and, once my client had approved one of my designs, I researched technologies we’d need for the project and began to code.</p>
                            <p>For the majority of the website, HTML and CSS was all that was required. I used Skeleton.css, which I heavily modified, as the main framework for the site. I used jQuery to create the responsive navigation menu. Then I taught myself enough PHP on the fly in order to implement a functional contact page.</p>
                            <p>I also handled getting the site hosted onto the server and performing some basic SEO functions in order to get the site recognized by Google.</p>

                            <p>The end result is a website that conveys essential information about The Dog Within in a way that is intentionally branded, user-friendly, responsive, and contains a fully functional contact form (meeting all of the client requirements).</p>
                            <p>Also of note, the owner of The Dog Within reported a significant increase in business as a result of having the site up and running.</p>
